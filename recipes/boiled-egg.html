        <h2>Boiled eggs are fun for the whole family!</h2>
        <p>When I was a small boy in france I used to walk 36 miles to the local store.  To keep me going on those long treks my mother would put a boiled egg in my pocket for a snack.</p>
        <p>This is the detailed recipe for that snack.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
